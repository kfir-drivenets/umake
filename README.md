UMake
=====
**Blazing Fast. Sub second Modification detection. Just a few seconds for cached compilation**

Overview
--------
UMake is a build system that building your projects.
influenced by [`tup`](http://gittup.org/tup/).

* local cache - disk cache
* remote cache - minio
* auto dependency discovery using strace
* simple configuration language

Since a lot of the core concepts from tup apply to umake it is highly recommended to read the following:

* http://gittup.org/tup/ex_dependencies.html
* http://gittup.org/tup/make_vs_tup.html

Running example
---------------

```
git clone https://github.com/grisha85/umake.git
cd umake
docker build -t umake  .
docker run --rm -it -v`pwd`/example:/example -w/example umake bash
umake --no-remote-cache
./hello_world
```

UMake configuration
-------------------
This section lists all the various configurations that umake supports

| Variable name                  | Description                                                |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| UMAKE_CONFIG_MINIO_ACCESS_KEY  | An access key (username) for minio that umake should use   |
| UMAKE_CONFIG_MINIO_SECRET_KEY  | A secret key (password) for minio that umake should use    |
| UMAKE_CONFIG_MINIO_BUCKET_NAME | The name of the bucket to use in minio                     |
| UMAKE_CONFIG_MINIO_URL         | A url to use to access minio                               |
| UMAKE_CONFIG_LOCAL_CACHE_SIZE  | The maximal size in bytes of the cache to store locally    |
| UMAKE_CONFIG_ROOT              | The root directory in which all umake files will be stored |

How UMake works
---------------
* loading compilation graph (DAG) from previous build (graph is empty when built first time)

* scannig filesytem using the loaded graph to check for changes

  * `modified` - if file was modified on filesystem it marked as modified on the graph
  * `deleted` - if file was deleted from the filesystem, successor target deleted as well from the filesystem and the graph


* parsing UMakefile and creating new commands or updating the existing

  * `deleted` - if command deleted, targets of this command deleted as well from both graph and filesystem
  * `updated` - if command is updated, UMake will handle it as `delete` and `create`. so, target of the old command will be deleted and new target will be created when graph will be executed
* executing the graph in parallel

  * `auto dependency detection` - updating the graph with accessed files by parsing strace logs
  * `cache` - saving to cache. more details: [Cache System](#cache-system)
* saving the build graph

Note: by automatically deleting `targets` when no longer needed (either `command` is delete or source file was the deleted for this `target`) UMake implementing `clean` by design. So `clean` no longer need to be mainained.

UMakefile
---------
## Rule `:`

A single `command` is generated for this rule

`:` source `|` manual-deps `>` cmd `>` target

`manual-deps` - targets the this target depends on, helps keep a correct build order
`cmd` - bash command
`target` - the output of the command

`{filename}` - full path filename of the source `/my/path/filename.a`
`{dir}` - directory containing the source `/my/path/`
`{noext}` - filename without extension `filename`
`{target}` - expanded target `helloworld.a`

Example:
```
: *.o > gcc {filename} -o {target} > helloworld.a
```

#### Recursive Source `**`
recursice dependencies are support
```
root\
  a\
    a.a\
      a.a.a
      a.a.b
      a.b.a
    a.b\
      a.b.a
      a.b.b
  b\
    b
```
* `root/**` -> (`a.a.a`, `a.a.b`, `b`)
* `root/a/**/*.b` -> (`a.a.b`, `a.b.b`)

#### Manual Dependency `|`
In order to maintain a correct build order (that is executed in parallel), there are use cases where manual dependecy is needed. for example: if there are `generated headers` (like when using `protobuf`) that are being later used by another `command` to generate a different target.


## Rule `:foreach`
Same as `:` but will create `command` for each `source` file existing on filesystem (like when we match the pettern *.o in the example above)

## Macro `!`
Macros are expanded immediately (like using `#define X "hello"` in c/cpp)
Macros can accept input parameters (again, similar to using c/cpp macros)

Example:
```
!c(includes, flags) : gcc -g -O2 -Wall -fPIC -c {filename} $includes $flags -o {target} > {dir}/{noext}.o
```
#### Default values
`Macro` supports default values, by default they are `""`:
```
!c(includes, flags=-O3) : gcc -g -O2 -Wall -fPIC -c {filename} $includes $flags -o {target} > {dir}/{noext}.o
```
now `!c` can be called as following:
```
!c(-Iinclude)       # includes = -Iinclude, flags=-O3
!c(-Iinclude, -O0)  # includes = -Iinclude, flags=-O0
!c()                # includes = "", flags=-O3
```
## Const `$`
Consts are like macros, and can be used to parametrize calls to macros
Example:
```
$libs = -lpthread
!so($libs)
```

## Config `[<config_item>:<config_value>]`
Configs allow to configure and changing umake execution.

#### `workdir`
Default: \<root>

Change the current working directory.
`relative paths` will now be relative to the new working dir.
`Absoulte paths` will now be relative to the `root` (the directory where UMakefile exists).

Example:
Relative path `my_dir_a/my_dir_b` will be evaluated as `<workdir>/my_dir_a/my_dir_b`.
However `/my_dir_a/my_dir_b` will be evaluated as `<root>/my_dir_a/my_dir_b` *regardless* of what our `workdir` is.

The following rules are similar:

```
: src/packages/a > gcc > src/packages/b
```
```
[workdir:src/packages]
: a > gcc > b
```
Return to root
```
[workdir:/]
```

#### `variant`

Defult: "default"

The ability to generate diffrent variants from the same sources. For example: debug/release compilations. variant `terminated` with a `newline`
```
# varaint is terminated with newline
[variant:default]
$cflags = -O3

[variant:debug]
$cflags = -O0

: my.c > !c($cflags) > my.o
```
now compile with `umake` for default variant
```
umake
```
or
```
umake --variant debug
```
for `debug` variant.

#### `include`
Default: -

include another `UMakefile` into the current one.
```
[include:somedir/umakefile]
```
will open and parse `somedir/umakefile` in the current working dir context.
# Cache System
Targets are being cached after creation, and checked if the target is in cache just before executing a `command`. There are two types of cache that UMake is using local (filesystem) and remote (minio).

## How Cache works
### On Save
* `sha1` of the target sources (those that were generated from UMakefile) are being calculated and `sha1` of the `command` itself. All dependecies files (also those that were auto detected) Saved to `md-<calculated_hash>` file.
* `sha1` of all dependecies are calculated and the just created target is saved to `<all_dependecies_hash>/<target_name_hash>`
### On Load
* `sha1` of the target sources (those that were generated from UMakefile) are being calculated and `sha1` of the `command` itself. Reading `md-<calculated_hash>` for all the file dependencies
* calculating `sha1` of all of the target dependencies (from the files system) and copying `<all_dependencies_hash>/<target_name_hash>` to the project directory as it was generated by the `command`

## Local Cache
The local cache is stored in `~/.umake/build-cache`.

## Remote Cache
umake support uploading the artifacts to a remote server. The more people that work on the same code base the more the remote cache will work.
Think of it like that, if someone in the office already build a file then there is no need to build it again. This concept speeds up local builds, since if someone
else already built the binary we just download from the cache. It also speeds up CI builds, since in most cases developers compile & test their code locally.

### Using minio as a umake remote cache
[Minio](https://min.io/) is a high performance open source object storage. It is compatible with AWS S3. It is very easy to set it up using the official [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/minio/minio/). Connecting it umake is also very simple.

#### How to run minio for umake
We need to start a minio server and make sure that it exposes a port via docker.
Use the following command to spin up the server:
```
docker run \
  -e MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=umake \
  -e MINIO_SECRET_KEY=umakeumake \
  -p 9000:9000 \
  minio/minio server /data
```
Note that you need to select a password and a username. In this example it's umake/umakeumake.
For more minio configurations refer to the [docs](https://github.com/minio/minio/blob/master/docs/config/README.md).
Now that the server is up and running we need to create a bucket for umake.
The simplest way to do it is via the minio web interface.

* Access http://localhost:9000 and user the username and password you selected.
* Create a new bucket called umake-build-cache

And that's it! we are good to go. Let's test it out using the example in the repo
